# 28 June 2019 Reading Array and Objects

## Arrays Pages 70-73

- Special type of variable, that doesn't store just one value, it stores a list of values
- Used when you are working with a **list**, or set of values, that are **related** to each other
- Helpful when you don't know how many items a list may contain, you don't need to specify how many values it will hold
- Array can be suited to storing individual items on a shopping list because it is a related items
- An arrray can have a name, just like you would do when creating any other type of variable
- Values are assigned to the array inside a square bracket, each value is seperated by a comma
- Values do not need to be the same data type
  * String/s, number/s, and a Boolean all can go in the same array
    -Boolean = a binary variable, having two possible values called “true” and “false.”
- **Array Literal** is the technique for creating an array, prefered method, values can be written on a seperate line
- **Array Constructor** uses new keyword followed by `Array();`, values are then specified in paratheses and each value is seperated by a comma
- **Index** A number of each item in the array

## Objects Pages 100-107, 116-119

- Objects group together a set of variables and functions to a create a model of a something you would recognize from the real world
  * Variables and functions take on new name
- **Propery** what a variable is called when it is part of an object
  * Can tell use about the object, such as:
    - Name of hotel
    - How many rooms that it has
      * Each individual hotel may have a different name and a different number of rooms
- **Method** what a function is called when it is part of an object
  * Tasks that are associated with the object
  * You can for example:
    - Check how many rooms are available by subtrating the number of booked rooms from the total number of rooms
- **Key** the names of the values stored within Javascript
- Object can not have two keys
- Keys are used to access corresponding values

### Storing Data

- Data is represented uing name/value pairs
- To organize, you can use array or object to group a set of related values
- Variables
  * Just one key and one value
  * Seperated from value by `=` (assignment operators)
  * To retieve value, use it's name
-Arrays
  * Store multiple pieces of information
  * Seperared by a comma
  * Order is important because items are assigned a number
  * Put in square brackets
  * To retrrieve item, use it's index number
- Individual Objects
  * Objects store sets of names/value pairs
  * Properties or Methods
  * Order is not important
  * When good:
    - Storing/transmiting data between applications
    - Global or configuration objects that set up information for the page
