## Function Declarations vs Function Expressions

- JS Interpreter:
  1. First Pass: Looks for functions and variables
  2. Second Pass: Looks for executable code

- That means that the way that we right write our functions matters
- Function types:
* Declarations:
  1. `function name (a,b){}`
    - This gets stored on the first pass
    - You can put this anywhere in your code and it will run
    - You can call this function on the very first line and then write the function at the very bottom
* Expressions:
  1. `var sum = function(a,b){}`
  - Only the var sum gets stored on the first pass
    - You must call this function after you declare it

## Code Organization

- Top:
1. global variables = variables that can be used throughout the code
  - anyone can access them and they take up memory
2. constructor functions
  - prototypes
3. object instances are bellow the construtor functions

- Middle:
  1. Helper functions
  2. Event Handlers

- Bottom:
1. Executable Code
  - Stuff that runs on page load
  - Event listeners
