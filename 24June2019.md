## Source of Notes: Jon Duckett Javascript Book  

### Notes from Class  

* **operator** A symbol that does stuff  
* = 'assignment' operator
* `<link>` link css to html  
* `<script src="too.js"></script>` link javascript to html  

### Pages of 1-24

#### Script  

* Series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal  
* You can compare scripts to the following  
  - Recipes  
    * Following steps one-by-one, cooks can create a dish that they have never made before  
    * Some scripts are simple and only deal with one individual scenario, like making a simple dish  
    * Some scripts cn perform multiple tasks, like when reading recipes for a complicated three-course meal  
* Browser may use different parts of the script, depending on user interacting with the website  

#### Writing a Script  

1. Define the Goal  
2. Design the Script  
  - Tasks  
    * Work out individual tasks needed to achieve it  
      - Steps  
        * Each task may be broken down into a sequence of steps 
        * When learning a new language, you need to get to grips with the:  
          * **Vocabulary** Words computers understand  
          * **Syntax** How you put those words together to create instructions  
3. Code Each Step  

### Pages of 74-79  

#### Expressions  

* Evaluates into (results in) a single value, broadly speaking two types of expressions  
  1. Expressions that just assign a value to a variable  
    * i.e. `var color = 'beige';` The value of the color is now beige  
      - For variable to be useful, it needs to be given a value  
  2. Expressions that use two or more values to return a single value  
    * i.e. `var area = 3 * 2;` The value of the area is now 6  
      - Expression 3 * 2 evaluates into 6  

#### Operators  

* Expressions rely on things called operators; they allow programmers to create a sinlge value from one or more values  
  - Assignment Operators `color = 'beige';`
  - Arithmetic Operators `area = 3 * 2;`
    * Addition `+` Adds one value to another
    * Subraction `-` Subtracts one value from another
    * Division `/` Divides two values
    * Muliplication `*` Multiples two values using an asterik
    * Increment `++` Adds one to the current number
    * Decrement `--` Subtracts one from the current number
    * Modulus `%` Divides two values and returns the remainder
  - String Operators `greeting = 'Hi' + 'Molly';`
    * **Concatenation** Process of joining together two or more strings to create one string
      - `var firstName = 'Ivy;'` `var lastName = 'Stone;'`
        * Using the variable called fullName, it would hold the string 'Ivy White'
          - `var fullName = firstName + lastName;`
      - Quotes around a number, it is a string
        * i.e. `var cost1 = '7';` 'var cost2 = '9';` then `var total = cost1 + cost2;` so string would say 79
      - When you try and add numeric data type to a string, then the number becomes part of the string, like when adding a house number to a street
        * i.e. `var number = '12';` `var street = 'Ivy Street';` `var add = number + street;` the string would say 12Ivy Street

### Pages of 88-94  

#### Functions

* Functions allow you to group a series of statements together to perform a specific task
