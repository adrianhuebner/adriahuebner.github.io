# 26 June 2019 Reading on Loops

* Check a condition, if true code block will run
  - Condition will be checked again, if still true then will run again
  - Repeats until condition returns false

1. For = the condition is usually a counter which is used to tell how many times the loop should run
2. While = the condition can be something other than a counter, and the code will contiue to loop for as long as the condition is true
3. Do While = similiar to while, will always run the statements inside the curly braces at least once, even if the condition evaluates false 
`for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++){
  document.write(i);
}`

* For loop, uses a counter as condition
  - Instructs the code to run a specified number of times
  -Condition made up of three statements:
    1. Initialization commonly called `i` acts as the counter, only created the first time the loop is run `var i = 0;`
    2. Condition, the loop should continue to run until the counter reaches a specified number `i < 10;` this loop will run 10 times before stopping
    3. Update, everytime the loop has run the statement in curly brackets, it adds one to the counter

- break = the termination of the loop and tells the interpreter to go onto the next statement of code outside the loop
- continue = tells the interpreter to continue with the current iteration, and then check the conditon again

-loops are helpful when dealing with arrays if you want the same code for each item in the array

- logical operators in Stephanie's words "the symbols that do things"
* `&&` = 'and'
* `||` = 'or'
* `!` = 'not', called bang
- comparison operators
* `===` equals
* `!==` not equal
* `>` greater than
* `<` less than
* `<=` less than or equal to
`>=` greater than or equal to
- artithmetic operators
* +, -, /, %, ++ = add 1, -- sub. 1
