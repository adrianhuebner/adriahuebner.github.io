# Welcome to My Learning Journal
## In this journal, I will be recording information that I learn while attending Code Fellows. 

My name is Adrian Huebner, I currently work at Starbucks and am furthering my education by attending Code Fellows. In my spare time when I am not making coffee :coffee: :tea: or studying :school_satchel: or tutoring my stuborn :unamused: godchild, I am reading a book :book: from my vast libray.

### 17 June 2019 --Growth Mindset Thinking---
**Here is what my descripton of what _Growth Mindset Thinking_ is**
I believe that Growth Mindset is about praising and rewarding effort rather than qualities, i.e. artistic ability, intelligence.

## Things I will remind myself of, when I find that I get frustrated and fall back in a _Fixed Mindset_
1. It's **meant** to be hard
2. Not...**yet**
3. Challanges **will help** me grow
4. My **effort and attitude** determine my abilites
5. I will be **inspired by the success of others**
6. Feedback is **constructive**
7. I **can** learn to do anything that I want to

## One of the **Most** important things that I will remind myself of:
## _Failure is an opportunity to grow_

### 17 June 2019 --Explanation of Markdown and Syntax--

## Markdown

- Markdown is light weight language in coding that is a way to style text that you see on the web
- What stood out to me was that Markdown is just regular text that has non-alphabetic characters that tell the word that you write what to do
-Markdown allows me to do things like _make this font italic_ or allows me to **make this bold** or say, oops I made a mistake ~This isn't what I wanted to say~ 

## Syntax

- Syntax is the part of a programming language that is the set rules that that define how the combination of non-alphabetic characters 
Some expamples of Syntax are:   
** ** This makes words bold  
_ _ This makes words italic    
:EMOJISGOHERE:   
~ ~ This means I want to cross these words out   
You can use this symbol to make a quote >   
I can make a task list by using these symbols [  ]   
And when I am done with a task list item if I add ad x between the square brackets it will make a box that is checked   

### 19 June 2019 Revisiting What I Learned on Monday

- Remember to put multiple spaces between lines that I want to start a new line with   
- I will remember that there are multiple says of making italic font by either doing the syntax: ** or _ _ and putting the words between the symbols  
- After taking the test on Tuesday, I will **always** remember that an ! (explamation point) goes in front of the image that I am trying to put in   
- From learning about _Growth Thinking_, I will remember to always ask my classmates, teachers, or others for help when I need it  


You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/adrianhuebner/adriahuebner.github.io/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

```

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/adrianhuebner/adriahuebner.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
