### 17 June 2019 --Growth Mindset Thinking---
**Here is what my descripton of what _Growth Mindset Thinking_ is**
I believe that Growth Mindset is about praising and rewarding effort rather than qualities, i.e. artistic ability, intelligence.

## Things I will remind myself of, when I find that I get frustrated and fall back in a _Fixed Mindset_
1. It's **meant** to be hard
2. Not...**yet**
3. Challanges **will help** me grow
4. My **effort and attitude** determine my abilites
5. I will be **inspired by the success of others**
6. Feedback is **constructive**
7. I **can** learn to do anything that I want to

## One of the **Most** important things that I will remind myself of:
## _Failure is an opportunity to grow_
