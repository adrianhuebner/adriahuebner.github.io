###  --Revisiting What I Learned on Monday--

- Remember to put multiple spaces between lines that I want to start a new line with   
- I will remember that there are multiple says of making italic font by either doing the syntax: ** or _ _ and putting the words between the symbols  
- After taking the test on Tuesday, I will **always** remember that an ! (explamation point) goes in front of the image that I am trying to put in   
- From learning about _Growth Thinking_, I will remember to always ask my classmates, teachers, or others for help when I need it  

### --Choosing a Text Editor--

#### What is a Text Editor?
##### A text editor is software that allows users to imput and edit text.

Atom | Visual Studio Code
------------ | -------------
Brought to people by Github | Brought to people by Microsoft
Have to save file to find errors | Underlines errors automatically
Doesn't seem as quick | Seems to funcation faster for day to day stuff
No Auto Completion | Has Auto Completion
Use alt-shift-cmd-F to find references | Hover over reference to find all other references

I think that it is important for software developers to be careful about what they choose as a text editor because everyone has a differnet way of processing things so you need to choose a program that works best with you.

###  --Cheat Sheet for Terminal Use--
#### Here I am providing myself with a cheat sheet that I can reference whenever needed in the future

##### Master the Command Line!
- The Command Line, also known as the terminal, running BASH   
- A command line, is a text based interface to the system. You can give the terminal commands by typing in text and recieveing an "answer", feedback, in text   
- **Line 1** Provides a prompt, typically the first thing you write is a command
- **Lines 2-5** Output from running the command, most output will be directly under the line with the command. *There are commands that only produce their task, won't list information, UNLESS there is an issue*
- **Line 6** Presents us with the prompt again  

###### OPENING A TERMINAL APPLICATIONS -> UTILITIES

##### Basic Navigation   

Shorthand | What Shorthand Does
------------ | ------------
pwd | Print Working Directory= Where are we currently
ls | List= List of the contents of directory
cd | Change Directories= Move to another directory

**RELATIVE PATH** Specify a file or directory in relation to the where we are currently in the system, they will not have a forwad slash.    stora
**ABSOLUTE PATH** Specify a file or directory in relation to the root directory, you can identify them with the start of a forward slash ( / )    

*MORE ON PATHS*    
~ (tilde) Shortcut to home directory    
. (dot) Reference to current directory    
.. (dotdot) Reference to parent directory   

###### _**Tab Completion**_  
When you start typing a path, you may hit the TAB key on your keyboard at any time which will invoke an auto completion action. If there are multiple options with what you begin typing in, if you hit the TAB key another time it will provide a list of possible options.    

##### Discover More About Files   

###### _**EVERYTHING IS A FILE**_   

**File**= Obtain information about what type of file a file or directory is    
**Is -a**= Lists the contents of a directory, including hidden files
