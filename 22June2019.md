## HTML & CSS Notes from Duckett    
### Chapter 18 Process and Design

~ **Big Question to ask yourself** Who is the target audience that your website is trying to reach?   

#### Target Audience: Individuals questions to ask
~ What is the age range of your audience?     
~ Is your audience more women or men? Or mix?     
~ What country is your audience from?    
~ Does your audience live in more urban or rurual areas?     
~ Average income?    
~ Level of education?    
~ Marital or family status?   
~ Occupation?
~ How many hours may they work during the week?    
~ How often is their internet usage?
~ What do they use to access the web?   

#### Target Audience: Companies questions to ask
~ SIZE of company?     
~ Relevant department?
~ What position is the people in the company who visit your site?    
~ Will visitors be using the site themselves or for other people?    
~ How large is their budget they control?    

#### Why People Visit Your Website   
~ Content and Design should be influenced by your users  
~ Discover the underlining **motivations** of your users  
~ Specific **goals** of your users  
~ General entertainment or specific goal?  
~ If specific goal, is it personal or professional  
~ Activity essential or luxury?  

#### What Information Does Your Visitors Need?
~ What information do people coming to your website need in order to achieve their goals?  
~ Additional information may need to be provided for what they may find helpful  
~ Why are they visiting your website and what are their goals?  
~ Prioritize levels of information from key points, non-essential or background  
~ Provide the info that your visitors need, what is most relevent to them  

#### Site Maps   
~ Create a diagram of pages that will be used to structure the site  
~ **Card Sorting** Placing each piece of information that a visitor might need to know on a seperate piece of paper and then organizing the related information into groups  
~ Groups relate to a page, on larger websites pages can in turn be grouped together to create different sections of the website  
~ Site map will usually begin with a home page
1. Home Page  
  * About 
    > History
    > Foundation  
    > Future Plans  
  * Articles  
    > News
    > Book Reviews
    > Press
    > Interviews
  * Visit 
    > Location
    > Opening Times
    > Tickets  
  * Shop
    > Books  
    > Gifts
  * Contact  

#### Wireframes  
~ A simple sketch of the key information that needs to go on each page of a site  
~ Designers will take elements of what need to appear on each page and then start creating wireframes  
~ Creating a wireframe means you can ensure that all the information that needs to get on a page is included  
~ Do not include color scheme, font choices, backgrounds or images for the site  
~ Make design easier because you know information that needs to appear  
~ Make sure that client gets to see the wireframe before the design, that way they can ensure that site has all functions  

#### Messages Across from Design  
~ Designer needs to **organize** and **prioritize** the information to communicate their message and help users find what they are looking for  
~ Make parts of the page **Distinct** from surrounding content  

#### **Visual Hiearchy** Help users focus on the key messages that will draw people's attention, and then guide them to subsequent messages  
  * **SIZE** Larger elements will grab users' attention first, because of this it's good to make headings and key points larger
  * **COLOR** Foreground and background color can draw attention to key messages, brighter sections tend to draw users' attention  
  * **STYLE** If something is the same size and color, but has a different style that will also grab users' attention
  * **IMAGES** Create high visual contrast and often attract the users' eyes first, they can be used to draw attention to a specific message that the site is trying to get across  

#### Grouping and Similarity  
~ Proximity  
  * When items are close together, users' perceive them as more related than items that are placed further apart  
~ Closure  
  * When there is a complicated arrangement of items, users' often will look for a single or recognisable pattern or form   
  * Imaginary or real box can be formed around elements due to their proximity and alignment    
~ Continuance  
  * Elements that are placed in a line or curve they are preceived to be more related to those that are not folloeing the same direction   
~ White Space  
  * Placing items closer together and leaving gap between unrealated items  
~ Colors
  * A background color place behind related items to emphasive connection  
~ Borders  
  * Line drawn around border of group or between it and it's neighbors  

#### Designing Navigation  
~ Concise  
~ Clear  
~ Selective  
~ Context  
~ Interactive  
~ Consistent  

### Skimming Chapter 1 Structure   

< HTML >This tells you what language is being used  
< body >This is information for the viewer  
< h1 >< /h1 >This is the Main Header  
< p >< /p >Introduction to the rest of the page  
< h2 >< /h2 >Sub-Heading  
< p >< /p >Information about Sub-Heading  
< h2 >< /h2 >Another Sub-Heading  
< /body >How to end the page of viewer  
< /html >Closing tag to html

### Chapter 17 HTML5 Layout  
Introducing a new set of elements that help define the struture of the page  

~ HTML5 Introduces a new set of elements that allow you to divide up the parts of the page  
~ Names of elements indicate the kind of content you will find in them  
~ Still subject to change, but that has not stopped many web page authors from using them already  

#### Headers and Footers < header > < footer >   
~ Main header and footer will appear on the top or bottom of every page on the site
~ A header or a footer for an individual < article > or < section > within the page  
~ For example, a page with several blog posts, each indivdual post can be thought of as a seperate section. The header element can contain the title and date of each post, the footer may provide links to share article on social network sites  

##### Navigation < nav >
~ Used to contain the major navigational blocks on the site  
~ Back to blog example, if you want to finish an article with links related to blog posts, these would not be counted as major navigational blocks and therefore should not sit inside a nav element   
~ Some of the developers that were using HTML5, decided to use the nav element for the links that appear at the bottom of everypage  

#### Articles < articles >
~ Element that acts as a container for any section of a page that could stand alone and potentionally be syndicated  
~ Could be for indidvual article or blog entry, a comment or forum post, or any other independent piece of content  
~ If there are several articles, then each article will live in it's own element  
~ Can be nested inside each other  

#### Asides < aside >  
~ Has two purpose, depending on whether it is inside an article element or not  
~ When aside is inside an article, it should contain information that is relative to article but not essential to it's overall meaning  
~ When aside is outside of article, it acts as a container for content that is related to the entire page  

#### Sections < section >   
~ Groups related content together and typically each section would have its own heading  
~ Homepage, may be several section elements to contain different sections of the page, such as latest news, top products, and newsletter signup  
~ Because section groups related items, it may contain several distinct article elements that have a common theme or purpose  
~ If you have a long article, the section element can be used to split article into seperate sections  
~ **Should not** be used as a wrapper for the entire page, unless the page contains only one piece of content

#### Heading Groups < hgroup >
~ Purpose is to group together set of one or more h1 through h6 elements so that they are treated as one single heading
