### 17 June 2019 --Growth Mindset Thinking---
**Here is what my descripton of what _Growth Mindset Thinking_ is**
I believe that Growth Mindset is about praising and rewarding effort rather than qualities, i.e. artistic ability, intelligence.

## Things I will remind myself of, when I find that I get frustrated and fall back in a _Fixed Mindset_
1. It's **meant** to be hard
2. Not...**yet**
3. Challanges **will help** me grow
4. My **effort and attitude** determine my abilites
5. I will be **inspired by the success of others**
6. Feedback is **constructive**
7. I **can** learn to do anything that I want to

## One of the **Most** important things that I will remind myself of:
## _Failure is an opportunity to grow_

### 17 June 2019 --Explanation of Markdown and Syntax--

## Markdown

- Markdown is light weight language in coding that is a way to style text that you see on the web
- What stood out to me was that Markdown is just regular text that has non-alphabetic characters that tell the word that you write what to do
-Markdown allows me to do things like _make this font italic_ or allows me to **make this bold** or say, oops I made a mistake ~This isn't what I wanted to say~ 

## Syntax

- Syntax is the part of a programming language that is the set rules that that define how the combination of non-alphabetic characters 
Some expamples of Syntax are:   
** ** This makes words bold  
_ _ This makes words italic    
:EMOJISGOHERE:   
~ ~ This means I want to cross these words out   
You can use this symbol to make a quote >   
I can make a task list by using these symbols [  ]   
And when I am done with a task list item if I add ad x between the square brackets it will make a box that is checked
