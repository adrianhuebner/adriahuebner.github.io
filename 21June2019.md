#### Version Control   
- System allows you to revisit various versions of a file or set of files by recording changes
- Allows one to revert a file or a project to a previous version, track modifications, and modify individuals and compare changes    
**Local Version Control (VCS)**   
- One database on your hard drive that stores changes to the file   
- For a single individual      
**Centralized Version Control (CVCS)**   
- Single server, storing all changes and file versions, can be accessed by various clients
- Meant for a team of developers working on a colaboration together
- Allows everyone to have more information about team workers activities      
**Distributed Version Control (DVCS)**   
- Allows clients to create mirrored repositories
- Everyone is allowed to work with each other in multiple ways to complete a joint project        

#### What is GIT?    
- A DVCS that stores data in a system made up of **snapshots**   
- A **commit**, each time you save your project, Git creates a snapshot of the file and stores a reference of it
- Because most necessary information can be found in local resources, it mostly relies on **local operations**   
      * This allows for process expediency, because a project resides on a on local disk, meaning that it doesn't have to fetch from a server.      
      * This allows one to work on a project when not online or on a VPN     
- Every single change applied to a file or directory is tracked by Git.     
- Git, will **always** detect file corruption or loss of info in transit     

#### File States of Git    
- **Committed** Data is securely stored in local database    
- **Modified** File has been changed but not committed to database   
- **Staged** Flagged a file's changed version to be committed in the next snapshot
